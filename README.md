# Hello Guys! Join me in my DSA Preparation to crack MAANG and other top companies.

## Here, I'll be adding all the problems I solve along with the resources I use so that you guys can follow. And also, if you are starting to prepare or want to prepare alongside me, you can reach out to me via LinkedIn. I'm open to pair programming and appreciate it very well 😁

### + **Step 0:** First lets warm up our programming skills by coding these [patterns](https://github.com/klpranaav/DSA-Preparation/blob/main/patterns.cpp). Note the patterns are just to give life to our dead logical thinking 😂 and to brushup our for loops.
